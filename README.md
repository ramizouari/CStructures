#CStructures
CStructures is a library consisting of C data structures.
It is built mainly for the purpose of providing C data structures.
## Rationale
Data structures are used very often, and when used properly, they can offer a lot of space/time benefits.

While implementing the QIde project, as the parser was written in C, We needed to use efficient data structures to store the parsed data. And as the C programming language does not offer generic programming, we needed to write our own data structures.

So as said before, In this library we provide a set of data structures that are used in the QIde project.

## Data Structures
We offer the following data structures:
1. `dynamic_array`: A dynamic array that can grow and shrink.
2. `hash_table`: A hash table that offers efficient practical access times.
3. `linked_list`: A linked list that can with efficient insertion.
4. `stack`: A stack implementation.
5. `queue`: A queue implementation.
6. `priority_queue`: A priority queue that .
7. `binary_search_tree`: A binary search with guaranteed logarithmic insertion, deletion, access, merge and join.
